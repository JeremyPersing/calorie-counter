# CalorieBalance
This is a MERN Stack web app that aims to help its users reach their weight gain, weight maintenance, or weight loss goals.
It allows the user to create an account, with OAuth2 if that is preferred, then input their stats and select an appropriate diet plan.
From there, theu can create meals, search for foods, and track what they ate throughout the day. Every night at 12 am, whatever the user
says they ate gets deleted from the server and they can come back the next day and input the what they eat. Depending on the plan that 
the user chose, there diet will either increase or decrease by 100 calories every 3 weeks.
The app uses the nutritionix API and pixabay API to search for food and images of food. It also uses JSON WebTokens for user registration
and logons.
